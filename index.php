 * A pseudo-CRON daemon for scheduling WordPress tasks
 *
 * WP Cron is triggered when the site receives a visit. In the scenario
 * where a site may not receive enough visits to execute scheduled tasks
 * in a timely manner, this file can be called directly or via a server
 * CRON daemon for X number of times.
 *
 * Defining DISABLE_WP_CRON as true and calling this file directly are
 * mutually exclusive and the latter does not rely on the former to work.
 *
 * The HTTP request to this file will not slow down the visitor who happens to
 * visit when the cron job is needed to run.
